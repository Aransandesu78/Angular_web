ADAS Synchro Resim Tool

## Description

Resim loops are followed-up by an Excel file, which is not intuitive and complicated to use, enhancing risks of mistake. A constant communication is therefore needed.

The angular application tool offers a better way to illustrate all resim request without being overwhelmed by a large amount of datas. Thanks to an intuitive interface, the application provides clarity and a better communication between members of a same team.

```bash
npm install -g @angular/cli
```
